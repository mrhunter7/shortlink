## Context

In the current project landscape, the integration of a robust and efficient chat functionality is paramount. 
This functionality is essential for facilitating real-time communication between users. 
The decision to design a separate boundary for chat functionalities stems from several critical needs:

1. **Modularity**: Ensuring that the chat component is a distinct module, enhancing maintainability and understanding of the system.
2. **Scalability**: Providing the flexibility to scale the chat service independently based on user demand without impacting other services.
3. **Independent Development and Deployment**: Allowing separate teams to develop, test, and deploy the chat service 
without dependencies on other components of the system.

The aim is to create a service that is not only functional but also resilient and adaptable to future requirements or 
changes in technology.

## Decision

We will implement a dedicated microservice for chat functionalities. This service will:

  1. Operate independently of other system components.
  2. Use WebSockets (or a similar technology) for real-time communication capabilities.
  3. Include features such as message history, real-time messaging, and user presence status.
  4. Be designed with a focus on high availability and low latency.
  5. Incorporate security measures such as data encryption and user authentication.

The microservice architecture will be leveraged to achieve the desired modularity and scalability.

## Consequences

**Benefits**:
1. Enhanced scalability and performance of the chat service.
2. Reduced complexity in the main application, leading to easier maintenance and development.
3. Ability to deploy updates and improvements to the chat service without disrupting the entire system.

**Challenges/Risks**:
1. Complexity in managing inter-service communication and ensuring data consistency.
2. Potential for increased infrastructure and operational costs due to the separate service.
3. The need for rigorous testing to ensure security and reliability.

Mitigation strategies will be employed to address these challenges, such as employing robust monitoring and logging, 
establishing clear communication protocols, and implementing comprehensive security practices.
