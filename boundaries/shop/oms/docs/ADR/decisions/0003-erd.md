# 3. ERD

Date: 2024-07-29

## Status

Draft

## Context

We need to understand the relationships between entities in our system.

## Decision

Adopt an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the relationships between entities in our system. 
This diagram will show how entities are related to each other and the cardinality of those relationships.

```plantuml
@startuml ERD_Customer_Items_Order

entity Customer {
  +customer_id: UUID [PK]
  --
  name: String
  email: String
  address: String
  phone_number: String
}

entity Item {
  +item_id: UUID [PK]
  --
  sku: String
  name: String
  description: String
  price: Decimal
  stock_quantity: Integer
}

entity Order {
  +order_id: UUID [PK]
  --
  order_date: DateTime
  status: OrderStatus
  total_amount: Decimal
  customer_id: UUID [FK]
  items: JSON
}

enum OrderStatus {
  "Pending"
  "Processing"
  "Shipped"
  "Delivered"
  "Cancelled"
}

Customer ||--o{ Order : places
Item ||--o{ Order : included in

## Consequences

Provides a visual representation of the relationships between entities in the system, aiding in understanding the data model and database design.
