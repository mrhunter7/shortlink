# 2. ScyllaDB for Chat Service

Date: 2024-01-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The chat service demands a database that can handle high volumes of messages and concurrent users efficiently. 
This requires support for high-frequency read/write operations, low latency, scalable architecture, 
and robust fault tolerance for a seamless user experience. 
As a user load increases, the database should scale accordingly without performance degradation.

## Decision

We have chosen ScyllaDB as our database solution for the chat service. ScyllaDB is an open-source, 
distributed NoSQL database optimized for high throughput and low latency on large datasets. Its compatibility 
with Apache Cassandra, combined with better performance and scalability, makes it a superior choice. 
A significant feature of ScyllaDB is its support for sharding and its ring architecture for data distribution and replication, 
which is crucial for scalability and efficiency.

Sharding in ScyllaDB allows each node in the cluster to handle only a part of the entire data, 
reducing the load on individual nodes and improving overall performance. This is particularly beneficial for our chat service, 
where data volume and read/write operations are expected to be high.

## Consequences

**Benefits:**
- **High Performance and Low Latency:** ScyllaDB is designed for high-speed data processing, which is essential for real-time chat applications.
- **Scalability:** The ability to horizontally scale and shard data ensures that our service can grow with increasing user demand.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Its distributed and replicated architecture enhances data availability and service reliability.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Sharding and ring architecture enable efficient data partitioning and load balancing across nodes.
- **Resource Optimization:** ScyllaDB's design allows for better utilization of hardware resources.

**Risks and Mitigations:**
- **Learning Curve:** The development team may require training to adapt to ScyllaDB's architecture and operational nuances.
- **Complexity in Management:** The complexity of managing a distributed and sharded database system requires robust monitoring and management strategies.
- **Limited Community Support:** ScyllaDB is a relatively new database solution, and the community support is not as extensive as other databases.
