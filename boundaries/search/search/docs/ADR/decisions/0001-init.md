# 1. Init Search service

Date: 2024-02-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We aim to launch a search service within our software system to facilitate quick and accurate information retrieval 
through full-text search capabilities. This service is essential for improving the efficiency and accuracy of the search process, 
allowing users to swiftly locate the information they require.

## Decision

To develop a search service capable of processing user queries effectively, ensuring the delivery of relevant search results. 
This service will incorporate advanced search functionalities, including filtering and sorting. 
We have decided to utilize gRPC API for the search service, enabling efficient, low-latency communication between 
the search service and other system components or services. This choice is motivated by gRPC's high performance, scalability, 
and the advantage of using protocol buffers, which are not only lightweight 
but also support a broad range of programming languages.

### Goals

- **Full-Text Search**: The search service should be capable of processing user queries effectively, ensuring the delivery of relevant search results.
- **Integration for Data Accuracy**: integration with other system domains to enable real-time data updates and maintain the freshness of search content.

## Consequences

The introduction of the search service, powered by gRPC API, will significantly enhance the user experience by providing 
a more efficient, accurate, and reliable search functionality. Users will benefit from faster response times 
and more relevant search results, thanks to the efficient data exchange facilitated by gRPC and the service's advanced 
search capabilities. The use of gRPC further ensures that the service is well-positioned to scale and adapt 
to increasing loads, maintaining high performance and reliability.
