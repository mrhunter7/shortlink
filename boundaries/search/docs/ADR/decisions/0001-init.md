## Context

The search service is crucial for enabling efficient and accurate information retrieval within our software ecosystem. 
The primary functional requirement of this service is to provide full-text search capabilities, 
allowing users to quickly find relevant information across large datasets. 
The search domain context is established to encapsulate these functionalities, focusing on indexing, querying, 
and real-time data synchronization. This setup aims to enhance user experience, data accessibility, 
and system performance.

## Decision

We have structured the search domain into key components to support the overarching 
goal of efficient information retrieval:

+ **Search service:** Responsible for indexing, querying, and managing search data.

Each component within the search domain is designed with a specific focus, ensuring that the search functionality 
is optimized for performance, scalability, and relevance.

## Consequences

This approach significantly improves the system's ability to provide timely and relevant search results, 
enhancing user satisfaction and system usability. By modularizing the search domain, 
we also ensure greater maintainability and scalability, allowing the system to evolve efficiently as data volumes 
and user demands grow.
